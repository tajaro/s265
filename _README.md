# Overview

These are my solutions to assignment problems from the University of Victoria class "Software Development Methods" (course no. "SENG 265").

I'm completing this to better understand software development methods, string manipulation, regex, and programming idioms. The assignments are written in C and Python.

Each assignment folder contains a pdf with program requirements and tests to compare results against. These were obtained from https://github.com/Hoverbear/seng-265-projects (although the solutions were ignored- this wouldn't be a very useful exercise if I copied someone else's answer!).

## Assignment 1

This assignment used C to configure a file to accept file inputs to change the margin and page width. This first assignment uses no dynamic memory allocation.
